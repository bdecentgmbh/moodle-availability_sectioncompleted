moodle-availability_sectioncompleted
========================

Moodle availability plugin which lets users restrict resources, activities and sections based on sections being completed


Requirements
------------

This plugin requires Moodle 3.9+


Motivation for this plugin
--------------------------

This plugin was built to enable teachers to easily restrict activities or sections to students that have completed another, usually the previous section.

This is currently already possible by adding several restrictions; this plugin simplifies that for the teacher â€“ and has also the nice and intended side effect that it looks better for the student.


Installation
------------

Install the plugin like any other plugin to folder
/availability/condition/sectioncompleted

See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_plugins for details on installing Moodle plugins


Usage & Settings
----------------

After installing the plugin, it is ready to use without the need for any configuration.

Teachers (and other users with editing rights) can add the "Section Complet" availability condition to activities / resources / sections in their courses. While adding the condition, they have to define the role which students have to have in course context to access the activity / resource / section.

Moodle release support
----------------------

This plugin is maintained for the two most recent major releases of Moodle as well as the most recent LTS release of Moodle. 

If you are running a legacy version of Moodle, but want or need to run the latest version of this plugin, you can get the latest version of the plugin, remove the line starting with $plugin->requires from version.php and use this latest plugin version then on your legacy Moodle. However, please note that you will run this setup completely at your own risk. We can't support this approach in any way and there is an undeniable risk for erratic behavior.


Translating this plugin
-----------------------

This Moodle plugin is shipped with an english language pack only. All translations into other languages must be managed through AMOS (https://lang.moodle.org) by what they will become part of Moodle's official language pack.
